    "- Project title: Childfree Life - What Brings Happiness to Married Couples Without Children in America?\n",
    "- Author: Tien Nguyen - tn2510\n",
    "- Project Summary: \n",
    "In contemporary America, the choice to lead a childfree life is increasingly prevalent. This project delves into the intricacies of happiness among married couples who have consciously opted out of parenthood. Through comprehensive research and interviews, several key inquiries were addressed to illuminate the facets of their contentment and fulfillment.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Key Questions Explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do they ever want children? Do they regret not having a child? Why do they not want children?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the motivations behind choosing a childfree lifestyle is fundamental. By delving into their desires, regrets, and reasons for opting out of parenthood, we unravel the intricate tapestry of their decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What personal achievements or career milestones are most commonly associated with happiness among married women without children?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the professional and personal accomplishments that contribute to their sense of fulfillment provides insights into alternative sources of joy and satisfaction beyond traditional family dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do leisure activities and hobbies contribute to their sense of joy and fulfillment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigating the role of leisure pursuits and hobbies sheds light on the diverse avenues through which individuals cultivate happiness and enrich their lives outside the realm of parenting."
