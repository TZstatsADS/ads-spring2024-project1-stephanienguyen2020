### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2024

+ Project title: Childfree Life - What Brings Happiness to Married Couples Without Children in America?
+ This project is conducted by Tien Nguyen (tn2510)

+ Project summary: In contemporary America, the choice to lead a childfree life is increasingly prevalent. This project delves into the intricacies of happiness among married couples who have consciously opted out of parenthood. Through comprehensive research and interviews, several key inquiries were addressed to illuminate the facets of their contentment and fulfillment.

Key Questions Explored:

1. Do childless married couples ever desire to have children? Do they regret not having a child?

2. What made married people without children happy?

3. Within a family without children, how can husbands make their wives happy?
